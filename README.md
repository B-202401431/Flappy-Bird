## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### üéÆ Game State Machine

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Boot
    Boot --> Menu
    Menu --> Gameplay: SPACE/UP
    Menu --> Difficulty: In main_2.py
    Gameplay --> GameOver: Collision
    GameOver --> Menu: Auto-return
    Difficulty --> Menu: Selection Complete
```

**Explanation**:  
- The game begins at the `Boot` state which sets up resources.  
- After boot, it transitions to the `Menu`, where difficulty settings can be adjusted.  
- Pressing SPACE/UP starts `Gameplay`.  
- Collision leads to `GameOver`, which returns to the menu automatically.  
- Difficulty screen exists only in `main_2.py` and feeds back into Menu upon selection.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Execution Flow

```mermaid

    A[Main] --> B[Initialize Pygame]
    B --> C[Load Assets]
    C --> D[WelcomeScreen]
    D --> E[MainGame]
    E --> F[HandleInput]
    E --> G[UpdatePhysics]
    E --> H[CheckCollisions]
    E --> I[RenderFrame]
    H -->|Collision| J[GameOver]
```

**Explanation**:  
- After initializing Pygame and loading assets, the game enters the welcome screen.  
- The main loop handles user input, physics updates, collision detection, and rendering.  
- A collision event transitions to the GameOver sequence.

## üîÑ Version Comparison

### ‚úÖ Feature Matrix

| Feature               | `main.py` | `main_2.py` |
|-----------------------|-----------|-------------|
| Difficulty System     | ‚ùå        | ‚úÖ          |
| High Score Sound      | Basic     | Optimized   |
| Menu Navigation       | ‚ùå        | ‚úÖ          |
| Dynamic Pipe Gap      | Fixed     | Variable    |
| Speed Adjustment      | ‚ùå        | ‚úÖ          |

### üìù Code Difference Snapshot

```diff
# main.py (Original)
def getRandomPipe():
    offset = SCREENHEIGHT / 3
    y2 = offset + random.randrange(...)

# main_2.py (Enhanced)
def getRandomPipe(pipe_gap=140):
    y2 = offset + random.randrange(...)
    y1 = pipeHeight - y2 + pipe_gap  # Dynamic gap
```

**Explanation**:  
The improved version introduces adjustable pipe gaps based on difficulty, making the game more dynamic and replayable.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Systems

### üïπÔ∏è 1. Physics Engine

```python
def update_bird():
    # Apply gravity
    if bird_velocity_y < MAX_VELOCITY:
        bird_velocity_y += GRAVITY
    
    # Handle flap
    if flap_triggered:
        bird_velocity_y = FLAP_IMPULSE
        play_sound('wing')
    
    # Update position
    bird_y += min(bird_velocity_y, GROUND_Y - bird_y - BIRD_HEIGHT)
```

**Explanation**:  
- Gravity increases the bird's downward speed until terminal velocity.
- A flap immediately reverses the velocity, giving an upward boost.
- Vertical position is updated while ensuring the bird doesn't fall through the ground.

| Variable        | Value        | Description                    |
|----------------|--------------|--------------------------------|
| `GRAVITY`      | 1 px/frame¬≤  | Downward acceleration          |
| `FLAP_IMPULSE` | -9 px/frame  | Upward force when flapping     |
| `MAX_VELOCITY` | 10 px/frame  | Limits how fast bird falls     |

### üß± 2. Collision Detection

```python
def check_collision():
    bird_rect = pygame.Rect(bird_x, bird_y, BIRD_WIDTH, BIRD_HEIGHT)
    
    for pipe in pipes:
        upper_rect = pygame.Rect(pipe['x'], pipe['y'], PIPE_WIDTH, PIPE_HEIGHT)
        lower_rect = pygame.Rect(pipe['x'], pipe['y'] + PIPE_GAP, PIPE_WIDTH, PIPE_HEIGHT)
        
        if bird_rect.colliderect(upper_rect) or bird_rect.colliderect(lower_rect):
            return True
```

**Explanation**:  
- Uses axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABB) to detect collision between the bird and pipes.
- Ground and ceiling are handled separately via Y-position thresholds.

| Object       | Method                     | Sound Trigger     |
|--------------|-----------------------------|-------------------|
| Pipes        | Rectangle overlap (`colliderect`) | `hit.wav`        |
| Ground       | Y ‚â• GROUND_Y               | `die.wav`         |
| Screen Top   | Y < 0                      | No sound          |

## üÜï Enhanced Features

### üéöÔ∏è Difficulty System Architecture

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class DifficultySettings{
        +Easy: dict
        +Medium: dict
        +Hard: dict
        +get_params() dict
    }
    
    class Game{
        +apply_difficulty()
    }
    
    DifficultySettings --> Game : Provides config
```

**Explanation**:  
- `DifficultySettings` stores gap/speed for each difficulty.
- Game queries `get_params()` and adjusts `pipe_gap` and `pipe_speed` accordingly.

```python
DIFFICULTY_SETTINGS = {
    'Easy': {
        'pipe_gap': 160,
        'pipe_speed': 3
    },
    'Hard': {
        'pipe_gap': 120,
        'pipe_speed': 5
    }
}
```

### üß≠ Menu Navigation Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Player->>+Game: Press UP/DOWN
    Game->>UI: Highlight option
    Player->>+Game: Press ENTER
    Game->>DifficultySystem: Set params
    DifficultySystem-->>Game: Confirm
```

**Explanation**:  
- User uses arrow keys to choose difficulty.
- On ENTER, parameters are applied.
- Game transitions back to menu and then gameplay with new settings.
